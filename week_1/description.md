1. Create a function that returns a list consisting of a Boolean True/False value if an integer input n is prime or not, and an divisor of n, or 0 if there is none.
2. The prime factors of 13195 are 5, 7, 13 and 29. What is the largest prime factor of the number 600851475143?

Note that the solution of 1. does not necessarily need to use the function created in 1.

_Problem 2. is taken from [Project Euler.](https://projecteuler.net/problem=3)_
